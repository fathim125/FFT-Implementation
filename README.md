# FFT-Implementation

Implementation of FFT on a Function for Specific Frequency Components. The following three questions have been answered on matlab.

1.) Design a function with frequency components in the bands 0-10 Hz and 30-50 Hz with exactly Â½ of the energy in each band.

2.) Design a first order filter that passes ONLY the 0-10 Hz band. Filter the function. Compute the energy in each band.

3.) Design a first order filter that passes ONLY the 30-50 Hz band. Filter the function. Compute the energy in each band.
